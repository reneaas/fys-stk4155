# Solving differential equations (DEs) using neural networks

This project has implemented neural netword based methods to solve two DEs.

1. The one-dimensional diffusion equation
2. A DE with equilibrium states that are eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix.

We've written a [report](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/blob/master/project3/report/project3_report.pdf) that covers all the necessary theory, various results and critical discussion.

The [codes](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project3/codes) are divided in the subdirectories

1. [forward_euler](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project3/codes/forward_euler) where all codes pertaining to the implementation of the forward Euler finite difference scheme lies.
2. [neural_net](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project3/codes/neural_net) with codes implementing and testing the neural netowrk based methods.
3. [results](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project3/codes/results) containing various results (mostly figures).
