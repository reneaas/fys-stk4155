# fys-stk4155
Repository containing the course work of Maria Linea Horgen, Kaspara Skovli Gåsvær and René Alexander Ask in FYS-STK4155 at UiO.

FYS-STK4155 is a master's course in data analysis and machine learning.


### Project 1 - Data preprocessing, regression methods and resampling techniques.

In project we study three regression methods to fit data: ordinary least squares, Ridge- and Lasso regression.
We develop three solvers using a superclass and a set of derived classes in Python. We've incorporated resampling techniques such as empirical bootstrapping and k-fold cross-validation into these solvers. The code project can be found [here](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project1).


### Project 2 - A Comparative Study of Neural Nets and Vanilla Methods in Regression and Classification Tasks

In this project we take a deep dive into neural nets and various methods for regression and classification tasks. We develop codes in both Python and C++ which solves problems related to each of the three topics. The code project can be found [here](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project2)


### Project 3 - The Hitchhiker's Guide to Solving Differential Equations and Eigenvalue Problems Using Feed Forward Neural Networks

In this project, we study a method that uses neural networks to solve differential equations (DEs). We apply this to the one-dimensional diffusion equation and a DE whos equilibrium states are eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. The report written on the methods can be found [here](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/blob/master/project3/report/project3_report.pdf). The codes pertaining to the project can be found [here](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project3/codes).
