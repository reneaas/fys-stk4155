# A Comparative Study of Neural Nets and Vanilla Methods in Regression and Classification Tasks

In this project we take a deep dive into neural nets and various methods for regression and classification tasks. The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project2/report).

We specifically look at stochastic gradient descent (SGD), multinomial logistic regression and neural nets. The codes are thus separated into three subfolders, which can be found inside the *code* folder:
* [sgd_regression](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/maria/project2/codes/sgd_regression)
* [logistic_regression](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/maria/project2/codes/logistic_regression)
* [neural_network](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/tree/maria/project2/codes/neural_network)

For a more in-depth description of the codes, please read the code documentation inside each folder.

To run the codes of the project, we advise to clone the repository pertaining to this project.


## Generate data

The data used in this project, respectively data for Franke's function and the MNIST dataset, are generated by running the python script *create_data_files.py*, which can be found [here](https://github.com/reneaas/fys-stk4155/blob/maria/project2/codes/create_data_files.py). All of the necessary parameters are pre-defined, but can easily be changed inside the script.
